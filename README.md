# Duke Energy Analytics API

I have always wanted to know weird stuff about my electricity usage, such as how much I use on a given day, or how much I use over a given strech of time. 

Duke energy (provided you have a smart meter) lets you download a report in XML format of your energy usage in increments based on your smart meter settings. 

This report goes back to from what I can tell, your start of service at a given address.
